Hi, I'm Khaled, a Cybersecurity Analyst currently advancing my expertise in identity and cloud security with a focus on Microsoft Azure. I'm actively building real world hands-on experience to transition into a Cloud Security Engineer role. This portfolio showcases the skills I'm deveolping through practical labs created while preparing for the Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate (AZ-500) certification.


To set the stage, these demos were built in a dedicated Azure subscribtion named "Prima-Macula Prod Sub 1" representing the organization "Prima-Macula" within the enviorment. Each demo starts with a diagram to visually illustrate the scenario, components, and security controls in focus. These diagrams serve as an overview to take a look at the purpose of these concepts: 

## Hybrid Identity & SSO
## Privileged Access Management
## Conditional Access
## Network Security Group
